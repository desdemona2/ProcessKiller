# PROCESS KILLER

- This is an app which will list you top 20 processes by CPU usage or memory usage.
- **This is not a good looking app but it can kill hungry apps work**.
- **This app requires root, without root it is of no use**
- I made this on a very short period. So design is not great and this is not tested thoroughly and you might see some unwanted crashes.
- You can create an issue if find some issue or want something else from it.
- Google will flag it as **Potentially harmful app** probably because of its root capabilities. You can ignore it if you want. From my side this is not a harmful app if you know what you are doing.
